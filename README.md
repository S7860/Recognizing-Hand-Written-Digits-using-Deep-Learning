# Recognizing Hand Written Digits using Deep Learning
The algorithm incorporates the MNIST dataset for hand written Digits to train a neural network 
that requires a 2 hidden layers of 800 nodes each output layer would have 10 nodes - the nodes are 
numbered 0-9 and the output at each node will be value b/w 0-1. The node with the higher value will 
be the predicted output.
